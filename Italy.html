      <h2>Welcome to Italy</h2>
      <p class="lead"> Venice (/ˈvɛnɪs/, VEN-iss; Italian: Venezia, [veˈnɛttsja] (About this sound listen); Venetian: Venesia, [veˈnɛsja]) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is situated across a group of 118 small islands[1] that are separated by canals and linked by bridges, of which there are 400.[2][3] The islands are located in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay that lies between the mouths of the Po and the Piave Rivers. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork.[2] The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site.[2]
      In 2014, 264,579 people resided in Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000 live in the historic city of Venice (Centro storico). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), with a total population of 2.6 million. PATREVE is only a statistical metropolitan area.[4]
      The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BCE.[5][6] The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice. Venice has been known as the "La Dominante," "Serenissima," "Queen of the Adriatic," "City of Water," "City of Masks," "City of Bridges," "The Floating City," and "City of Canals."

  <li>Italy is beautiful in its own way, every Italian city is built in such a manner that it leaves you in awe. Venice had the picturesque canals; Florence possessed incredible structures dating back centuries; Cinque Terre was home to a collection of the most colorful houses I’ve ever seen.
  <li>If you visit Italy but you don’t visit Tuscany then you miss on a lot of romance. Tuscany is certainly one of the world’s most romantic regions to visit. The list of what makes Tuscany so romantic is endless such as wineries, Tuscan villas, rolling hills etc.
  <li>Italy is home to Europe's only three active vulcanoes: Etna, Stromboli and Vesuvius.

      <li>Around 3000 euros of change is thrown in The Trevi Fountain by tourists daily. It is than collected and donated to charity.
      <li>If you touch the right breast of the statue of Juliet,which can be found in Verona, it will bring you luck in finding your own true love. Perhaps a safer option than love notes today.
      <li>Milan's duomo is the church with the most statues. They say there are more statues on this gothic-style cathedral than any other building in the world. There are 3,400 statues, 135 gargoyles and 700 figures that decorate Milan Duomo! Climb the stairs or take the lift to the rooftop to fully appreciate the architecture of the most renowned silhouette in the city. From the terrazza you’ll see breathtaking views across Milan and, on clear days, the snow-capped peaks of the Alps. You can also see the famous Madonnina, the gold-colored statue of Mary that stands on the cathedral’s highest spire.
