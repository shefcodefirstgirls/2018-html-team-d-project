      <p>  Romania is a contry with great variety. Nature at its best is the pure definition of this country. The area of this beautiful country is equally distributed between mountains, hills and plains. Hence a lot of variety when it comes to landscapes.
        I was lucky enough to be able to really explore this country, starting from the west where my hometown is to the east of Romania. Of course, along the journey I saw some of the best sights Romania has to offer. </p>
      <h2> A bit of a did you know section? </h2>
      <ul>
    <li>The statue of Dacian king Decebal, carved in the rocky bank of the Danube River, is the tallest rock sculpture in Europe (135 feet tall).
    <li>The Romanian Palace of Parliament in Bucharest is the second largest building in the world, next only to the Pentagon in the United States.
    <li>Europe’s second largest underground glacier, the Scarisoara glacier, is found underneath the Bihor Mountains in Romania. It has a volume of 75,000 cubic meters and has existed for more than 3,500 years.

   <li>Its official. Romania has the most beautiful waterfall in the world. Bigar Cascade Falls in Caras-Severin it’s been voted as number one by The World Geography.
   <li>The Romanian “Merry Cemetery” of Sapanta, a tiny village in the Valley of Maramures is unlike any other cemetery in the world. This graveyard presents a very unusual and different way to look at death.  Each of its gravestones is carved in cheerful colors and darkly-humorous poems that offer a glimpse into the lives of the dead.
   <li>The Danube River flows 1,788 miles from its springs in Germany’s Black Forest to the Black Sea. Just before reaching the sea it forms the second largest and best preserved of Europe’s deltas: 2,200 square miles of rivers, canals, marshes, tree-fringed lakes and reed islands.
