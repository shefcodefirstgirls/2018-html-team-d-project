        Czech Republic is surely a marvelous contry. I was able to visit it a couple of years ago and that trip is still among my favourites. Unfortunately, I only managed to visit Prague, the capital,
        but it was enough to fall in love with this country. Prague is well known for having quite a lot of towers from which you can see the whole city, hence if you're an instagram fan, the scenery will amaze you.
        If you are not all about taking photographs, don't worry there are a lot of other things to do or see. For example, any beer lover should know that Czech Republic is well known for their beer industry, and I
        can assure you, mostly all of their pubs offer a great pint of beer for quite cheep.
