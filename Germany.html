        <p>Germany has a touch of everything: the majestic Alps, glorious miles of river and forest, fairytale castles, rejuvenating spas. Its cities are filled with art treasures as well as fine dining and irresistible shops.
          The exquisite wines are rivaled only by some of the world’s best beers. It’s no wonder Germany is such a popular destination.</p>
          <h2> A bit of a did you know section?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The capital of Berlin has more bridges than Venice – Berlin boasts 960 bridges and 59.8 square kilometres of water consisting of lakes and around 180 kilometres of navigable waterways. Combined with its surrounding state Brandenburg, it houses Europe's largest inland water network.
          <li>Germany is Europe's second largest beer consumer – Germans drank 2.55 billion gallons of beer in 2012, the lowest level since the reunification in 1990, but that's still more than anyone else in Europe apart from the Czechs. There are more than 1,200 breweries producing over 5,000 brands of beer.
          <li>Germany has nearly 700 zoological gardens, wildlife parks, aquariums, bird parks, animal reserves, or safari parks, including 414 registered zoos (more than the USA) ! Berlin's Zoologischer Garten is the largest zoo in the world, both in terms of number of species (1,500) and animal population (14,000).

        <ul>
          <li>The oldest sun observatory currently known in Europe is the so-called Goseck circle in Saxony-Anhalt. It was built some 7,000 years ago.
          <li>More museums than rainy days per year. There are 180 museums in Berlin and on average 106 rainy days. So even if you tried to use the bad weather for cultural enrichment you’d have a hard time getting through them all in a year.
          <li>
          <li>The Fersehturm, or Tv Tower around Alexanderplatz is the tallest structure in Germany at 368 meters high. We are all obsessed with it and love to take pictures of it and “from” it.  Actually, you can book a table at its revolving restaurant (Sphere) all the way up there and have a memorable brunch overlooking the whole city.
