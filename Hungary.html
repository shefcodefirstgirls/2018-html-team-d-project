        <p>A few hours away from the city I grew up in, Hungary was always easy to reach for me. There are a lot of reasons to visit this amazign country but the most important ones are: the capital and the aquaparks.
        It might sound a bit funny when you first read it, but honestly Hungary has the best aquaparks and a lot of them too. So, if I were you I wouln't miss the chance to relax a bit in a hungarian aquapark. Moving
        onto the capital, Budapest is simply marvelous. This city has so much to offer that I can't even begin to describe it. From awesome science museums and when I say awesome I mean it, to incredible scenery I garantee
        you will enjoy walking the streets of Budapest. </p>
        <h2> A bit of a did you know section? </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Thanks to an abundance of natural hot springs, Hungary can boast around 450 public spas and bathhouses. A prominent bathing culture has existed since Roman times; it is supposedly the best cure for a hangover – or “cat’s wail” as the Hungarian term macskajaj translates
          <li>Touching the pen of the statue of Anonymus in Budapest's City Park will, legend has it, bless you with great writing abilities. You may not believe it, but the shiny surface of the pen suggests that many still do.
          <li>Budapest has the second largest synagogue in the world. Seating 3,000, the Dohany Street Synagogue is the largest in Europe and part of the Budapest Unesco World Heritage Site.

          <li>After London, Budapest has the oldest underground train system in Europe. The line opened in 1896 in the year when Hungary celebrated its 1000th anniversary, hence the name Millennium Underground. It’s still in use as subway M1 and it connects the city center with City Park.
          <li>There are more than 40 theaters and over 100 museums and galleries in Budapest. Many concerts, festivals and events are held year-round, not to mention performances at the famous Opera House, which is considered to be among the best opera houses in the world.
          <li> The Budapest Zoo is one of the oldest zoos in the world.The Budapest Zoo opened its doors in 1865 and in addition to the animals it features a number of noteworthy Art Nouveau buildings and structures, like the Elephant House, the Palm House and the main entrance.
